# Javascript-Course
A repository to store code scripts created while taking a udemy Javascript course

The majority of every index.html and app.css files are provided by the instructor.
Every app.js file is coded by me, while following along with the instructor. In most cases, I tried a different approach than the instructor did.

My goal was to make the code simple to understand, and object-oriented.
